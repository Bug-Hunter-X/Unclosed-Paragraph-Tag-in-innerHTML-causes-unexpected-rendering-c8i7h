# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to using `innerHTML` to dynamically update content.  The bug arises from an unclosed paragraph tag within the string assigned to `innerHTML`, which can cause unexpected behavior in the browser's rendering engine.

## Description of the Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with a div element. A JavaScript script attempts to modify the content of this div using `innerHTML`. However, the string assigned to `innerHTML` contains an unclosed `<p>` tag, leading to improper rendering and potentially affecting the layout of the page. This might manifest as unexpected text wrapping or missing content.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file presents the corrected version of the code.  The unclosed paragraph tag is fixed, ensuring that the HTML is valid and renders correctly.
